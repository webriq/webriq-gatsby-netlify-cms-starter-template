## We Go Backpacking and Camping

Isn't it fulfilling and fun for having an opportunity to hike the forest, open trails, and seeing different kinds of living creatures? To reach the mountain highs, spending nights under the stars and to wake up witnessing the sunrise over the horizon?



## To Make Memories and Take Pictures

The best part of backpacking in the mountains is struggling and having fun together. Sure, we get tired and starved but that what makes our memories the best for we conquered the mountain together. One Goal, One Team. Let be the pictures be evidence of our once great moment of adventures.



## To Remember Our Great Adventures

We know, but the truth is... Time will pass by. Sooner or later, we won't have time anymore to spend time in the mountains together. Some may move to other places, some will get married or get busy with their careers. But one thing is for sure, our adventures together will continue to live until the last second of our time. :)
